# Webpack Practice

This is a website made using javascript and webpack. This is not
needed for a small site like this but for larger projects, though getting experience using developer tools and configuring webpack to load html, and css was a great learning experience for future more ambitious projects.

## What I did

- [x] Created my first webpack.config file from scratch to support different project needs
- [x] solidified my ability to interact with the dom using javascript
- [x] Used webpack development tools like webpack server and configured loaders to handle HTML & CSS
